openCatacomb is a conversion of the Catacomb pascal code to C code.
The code then was adpated to include changes that Catacomb 2 introduced.

openCatacomb uses SDL/OpenGL for system interactions.

Both games are playable with the current sofware.
The frontend is designed to detect and verify the data contents.
Check md5checksums.txt for which files required, or just copy
the original DOS folder.
